    <h1>AI Medical Devices: Where GMLP Strategies Break Down</h1>

    <div class="subtitle">
      An expert examination of why many Good Machine Learning Practice frameworks fail under regulatory scrutiny — and what manufacturers consistently underestimate.
    </div>

    <div class="executive-summary">
      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Despite widespread adoption of Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP) principles, many AI-enabled medical device programs encounter resistance during regulatory review and post-market evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        These failures rarely stem from a lack of technical capability. They arise from structural misalignment between machine learning development practices and the regulatory expectations governing medical device safety, performance, and lifecycle control.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Core Misconception: GMLP as a Compliance Substitute</h2>

    <p>
      Many organizations treat GMLP frameworks as a regulatory solution rather than what they are intended to be: development guidance.
    </p>

    <p>
      While GMLP improves data handling, model training, and performance evaluation, it does not replace the need for structured medical device governance, nor does it inherently satisfy expectations around risk management, change control, or post-market surveillance.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        <strong>Key observation:</strong> GMLP improves how AI is built, but regulators assess how AI-enabled medical devices are controlled over time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Weak Linkage Between AI Risk and Device Risk</h2>

    <p>
      GMLP discussions often remain confined to algorithm-level risks such as bias, overfitting, or data drift.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regulators expect explicit linkage between AI behavior, device hazards, potential clinical harms, and risk control effectiveness. When this linkage is missing, reviewers identify gaps between technical mitigation and patient safety assurance.
    </p>

    <h2>Change Control Breakdown for Model Evolution</h2>

    <p>
      Many AI strategies assume iterative improvement as a strength. From a regulatory perspective, uncontrolled or weakly governed model evolution represents systemic risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      GMLP principles rarely define when a model update constitutes a regulated design change, how revalidation thresholds are set, or how cumulative updates are assessed for safety impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Post-Market Surveillance Reduced to Performance Monitoring</h2>

    <p>
      In practice, post-market activities are often limited to monitoring model accuracy or drift metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regulatory authorities expect surveillance systems to detect new or underestimated risks, correlate AI outputs with real-world harm, and feed insights back into risk management and clinical evaluation processes.
    </p>

    <h2>Explainability Without Accountability</h2>

    <p>
      Explainability techniques are frequently presented as solutions to transparency concerns.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, explainability alone does not answer the regulator’s primary question: who is accountable when an AI-driven decision contributes to patient harm?
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        Without defined responsibility, escalation pathways, and decision oversight, explainability remains informational rather than protective.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>A Governance-First Approach to AI Medical Devices</h2>

    <p>
      Organizations that succeed embed AI development within existing medical device governance structures rather than treating it as a parallel discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      Risk management defines AI constraints, change control governs evolution, post-market data informs reassessment, and clinical responsibility remains clearly assigned.
    </p>

    <h2>Implications for Medical Device Leadership</h2>

    <p>
      The critical question for leadership is not whether GMLP has been implemented, but whether the organization can demonstrate sustained control over AI behavior across the product lifecycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Addressing these issues early reduces regulatory friction and establishes credibility in an increasingly scrutinized domain.
