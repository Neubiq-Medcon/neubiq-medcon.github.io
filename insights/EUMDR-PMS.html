    <h1>PMS Under EU MDR: What Auditors Expect vs What Companies Do</h1>

    <div class="subtitle">
      A practical examination of where post-market surveillance systems fall short during EU MDR audits — and why the gaps persist.
    </div>

    <div class="executive-summary">
      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Under EU MDR, Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) has shifted from a procedural requirement to a core regulatory control mechanism.
        Auditors increasingly treat PMS as a live system that demonstrates whether a manufacturer understands and controls real-world device performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite this, many organizations continue to operate PMS as a document-driven, retrospective activity. The result is a recurring gap between what auditors expect to see and what companies actually present during conformity assessments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What Auditors Expect PMS to Demonstrate</h2>

    <p>
      From an audit perspective, PMS is not about whether a plan exists. It is about whether the manufacturer can demonstrate ongoing awareness of device performance and emerging risks in the field.
    </p>

    <p>
      Auditors typically look for evidence that PMS data is actively collected, assessed, and fed back into the quality system — particularly into risk management, clinical evaluation, and CAPA.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        <strong>Auditor focus:</strong> Can the organization show that post-market data meaningfully influences decisions, or does it merely satisfy reporting obligations?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What Companies Commonly Do Instead</h2>

    <p>
      In practice, PMS is often reduced to periodic compilation of complaints, literature reviews, and vigilance data to support annual reports.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data is collected, summarized, and archived — but rarely analyzed in a way that challenges existing risk assumptions or triggers proactive system updates.
    </p>

    <p>
      This creates a compliance illusion: documentation appears complete, yet the system lacks responsiveness.
    </p>

    <h2>Disconnect Between PMS and Risk Management</h2>

    <p>
      One of the most frequent audit observations relates to weak linkage between PMS outputs and the risk management file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Manufacturers often state that PMS is reviewed, but cannot clearly demonstrate how specific post-market signals resulted in risk reassessment, updated controls, or justification for maintaining existing risk ratings.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        When PMS does not visibly influence risk management, auditors interpret this as a systemic weakness rather than a documentation gap.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>PMS as a Static Report vs a Living System</h2>

    <p>
      EU MDR expects PMS to function as a living system — continuously active, proportionate to device risk, and responsive to new information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many organizations, however, still treat PMS as an annual reporting exercise aligned to audit timelines rather than operational reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      This timing-driven approach becomes evident during audits when teams struggle to explain how post-market trends were identified, escalated, and acted upon between reporting cycles.
    </p>

    <h2>The Role of Cross-Functional Ownership</h2>

    <p>
      Another common challenge is unclear ownership of PMS activities across functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Quality may compile PMS reports, inputs often originate from Regulatory, Clinical, Service, or Commercial teams — without a clear governance model for integration and decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      Auditors increasingly probe how these interfaces are managed and whether responsibilities are clearly defined and exercised.
    </p>

    <h2>Implications for EU MDR Audit Outcomes</h2>

    <p>
      When PMS systems are passive or poorly integrated, audit findings tend to focus on lack of effectiveness rather than missing elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      These findings are difficult to close quickly because they reflect systemic behavior, not isolated omissions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Organizations that address PMS as an operational system rather than a reporting obligation experience fewer repeat observations and smoother surveillance audits.
