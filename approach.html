    <h1>Our Approach</h1>
    <p>
      We follow a structured, risk-based methodology to design and implement
      Quality Management Systems that are compliant, scalable, and audit-ready.
      Our approach aligns with ISO 13485, MDSAP, QMSR, and integrates AI lifecycle
      controls where applicable.

      <h3>1. Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        We begin by evaluating the current state of your Quality Management System
        against applicable regulatory and standard requirements. This includes
        reviewing existing documentation, processes, records, and organizational
        readiness.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px; color:#b0b6c2;">
        Output: Gap analysis, risk areas, and prioritized improvement actions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Based on assessment outcomes, we design a tailored QMS roadmap aligned
        to your product type, organizational maturity, and market strategy.
        Responsibilities, timelines, and compliance objectives are clearly defined.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px; color:#b0b6c2;">
        Output: QMS implementation plan, documentation structure, and milestones.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        We support hands-on deployment of QMS processes, procedures, and records.
        This includes documentation development, training, process rollout, and
        integration into day-to-day operations.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px; color:#b0b6c2;">
        Output: Operational QMS with trained personnel and controlled documentation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Validation & Readiness</h3>
      <p>
        We verify system effectiveness through internal audits, management review
        support, CAPA implementation, and audit readiness activities. For AI-enabled
        devices, model validation evidence and monitoring controls are reviewed.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px; color:#b0b6c2;">
        Output: Audit-ready QMS supported by objective evidence.
