      <h3>Our Focus</h3>
      <p>
        We work solely within the medical device domain, delivering QMS solutions
        aligned with ISO 13485, MDSAP, and QMSR requirements. This exclusive focus
        enables deep regulatory understanding and practical implementation.

      <h3>What We Deliver</h3>
      <p>
        Our consulting approach emphasizes audit-ready systems, not just documentation.
        We design QMS frameworks that integrate seamlessly into daily operations and
        stand up to regulatory scrutiny.

      <h3>AI-Enabled Medical Devices</h3>
      <p>
        Where applicable, we support QMS integration for AI-enabled medical devices
        by aligning AI lifecycle controls — including data management, model validation,
        change control, and monitoring — with ISO/IEC 42001 and ISO 13485 requirements.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        We believe compliance should be structured, efficient, and sustainable.
        Our work is guided by regulatory intent, risk-based thinking, and long-term
        system effectiveness rather than short-term certification goals.
